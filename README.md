In 1990, California experienced a significant surge in property prices, influenced by factors like a strong economy, rapid population growth, and limited land availability. This project aims to understand these dynamics and provide a data-driven approach to pricing properties effectively.

**Challenge:**
The challenge lies in accurately predicting house prices in various Californian locales, considering multiple factors that influence these prices, such as location, property type, and economic conditions.
